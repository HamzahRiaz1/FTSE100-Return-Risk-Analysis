## TASK

You have been receiving numerous advertisements from a social trading platform eDoro. The platform promises to provide a free account with no management fees and 0% com- missions on stock investments. You become interested in opening an account with eDoro, and investing in a portfolio consisting of two stocks. However, you are also aware that this investment carries a certain level of risk. Conveniently, you have recently enrolled on a course called "Decision and Risk", and you have learned copula-based models for mea- suring the market risk of a portfolio of financial assets. Your initial search for potential financial stocks resulted in the following six candidates for investment: 
1.	FTSE100 is a share index of the 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange with the highest market capitalisation.  
2.	S&P500 is an American stock market index based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies.  
3.	The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) Composite Index is a stock market index made up of all the A-shares and B-shares that are traded at the Shanghai Stock Exchange.  
4.	DAX is a blue chip stock market index consisting of the 30 major German companies trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.  
5.	Nikkei 225 is a price-weighted stock market index that includes the top 225 blue-chip companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  
6.	CAC 40 is a stock market index that represents a capitalization weighted measure of the the performance of the 40 largest and most actively traded shares listed on Euronext Paris.  

(a)  Select two stock indices of your choice and obtain data for weekly prices for the period 2000 - 2018 (you are free to choose any starting and ending weeks within the start and end year). [Hint: Data can be downloaded from finance.yahoo.com.] Using log-returns for these two stock indices, construct an equally-weighted portfolio. Estimate the 99% and 95% 1-week Value-at-Risk of the portfolio using the parametric approach. In your own words and using no more than 200 words, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of using the parametric approach in this context. [15]  
(b)  Now estimate the 99% and 95% Value-at-Risk of the portfolio from part (a) using the Monte Carlo simulation approach based on copula theory. In your own words and using no more than 200 words, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of using the Monte Carlo simulation approach in this context. [50]
